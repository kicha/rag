# Query Rewriting

Document ID: DOC-015

## Purpose

Query rewriting changes wording to better match corpus terminology while trying to preserve the original intent.

Operationally, this topic should be validated with reproducible experiments rather than a single example. Record configuration, candidate counts, ranking order, identifiers, latency, and failure cases. Similar vocabulary can appear in neighboring retrieval topics, so evaluation should reward the most directly relevant document rather than any document that merely shares technical words.

## Example

How does HNSW search efficiently can be rewritten toward graph traversal, upper-to-lower layers, and avoiding comparison with every vector.

Operationally, this topic should be validated with reproducible experiments rather than a single example. Record configuration, candidate counts, ranking order, identifiers, latency, and failure cases. Similar vocabulary can appear in neighboring retrieval topics, so evaluation should reward the most directly relevant document rather than any document that merely shares technical words.

## Risk

A rewriter can introduce assumptions or drift. Systems should retain the original query and may retrieve with both forms.

## Measure

Judge rewriting with downstream retrieval metrics rather than linguistic elegance.
