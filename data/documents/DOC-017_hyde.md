# HyDE

Document ID: DOC-017

## Idea

Hypothetical Document Embeddings generate an answer-like hypothetical passage, embed it, and use that embedding for retrieval.

Operationally, this topic should be validated with reproducible experiments rather than a single example. Record configuration, candidate counts, ranking order, identifiers, latency, and failure cases. Similar vocabulary can appear in neighboring retrieval topics, so evaluation should reward the most directly relevant document rather than any document that merely shares technical words.

## Bridge

The hypothetical passage may introduce terminology closer to the corpus than the original short question.

Record configuration, candidate counts, ranking order, identifiers, latency, and failure cases.

## Risk

The hypothetical document may hallucinate. It is only a retrieval aid and must never replace source evidence.

## Measure

Compare HyDE against original-query retrieval because its extra generation step adds cost and is not universally beneficial.
